## Information about the vcf files ###

- The vcf files here were constructed using the pipeline proposed by Harvey et al. 2016 (using scripts from Phyluce, Faircloth, 2016).

- For each original vcf file (from the pipeline), were extracted a second and final file with (a) only biallelic loci, and (b) a SNP per locus (using this script: https://github.com/caballero/Scripts/blob/master/rand_var_per_chr.pl).
